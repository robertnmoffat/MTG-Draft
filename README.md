# Description

This project is meant as a practice exercise in creating a full react app. There are other sites which have the same functionality and better drafting logic. This project is only meant to show a fully developed react app utilizing data accessed from an external API.

## Drafting process

If you are not familiar with the drafting process it is as follows:
1. Eight players are each given three sealed packs of cards.
2. Each pack contains fifteen randomized cards.
3. Each player removes one card from their pack and then passes the remaining fourteen cards to the player at their side.
4. This process is repeated until all of the cards have been selected.
5. The next pack is opened and the process is then repeated with this pack, passing cards to the opposite side instead.
6. Finally the process is repeated with the final pack after which all of the cards will have been drafted and decks will be built.

This project is only meant to emulate the drafting process up to the point which deck building begins.
